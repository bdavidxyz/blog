        <p>I am a freelance web developer, who work both on front- and back-end side, mostly with <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>JS</strong>, and <strong>Git</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have strong interest in usability and webdesign, this is why I love to use <strong>CSS3</strong> and all its modern tooling. </p>
        <p>In recent years, I have learned a lot about lean analytics, and applied my coding skills to <strong>growth</strong> and <strong>acquisition.</strong> </p>
